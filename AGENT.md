## 3. Detailed Implementation Plan (synthesised from `paper/main.tex` & `FLCTISIEONE.tex`)

### 3.0 Scope

Deliver a production-grade, differentiable Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) layer for PyTorch and integrate it into NanoGPT.  We adopt the fast chirp–FFT–chirp decomposition presented in §2 of _FLCTISIEONE.tex_, achieving **O(N log N)** complexity while leveraging cuFFT on GPU.

### 3.1 Repository Skeleton

  lct_math.md           # derivations, parameterisation
```

### 3.2 Core Algorithm (LCTLayer)

**Implementation order guideline:** Begin by shipping a **fully-general, CPU-only** version of `LCTLayer` with _no_ special-case branches or performance tweaks.  Ensure the layer works standalone and passes the validation suite **before** attempting GPU acceleration, NanoGPT integration, or any optimisation work noted later in this plan.

1. **Parameterisation**  
   • Three learnable **complex64** scalars `a, b, c` (`nn.Parameter`, stored as real–imag pairs ⇒ 6 real DOF).  
   • Compute `d` on-the-fly such that `ad − bc = 1`.  
   • Regularise near-singular branch (`|a|≤ε`) with Taylor fallback.
2. **Forward pass** (`b ≠ 0`)  
   Chirp–FFT–chirp:  
   `y = C₀ · exp(iπ a/b · x²) · FFT[ exp(iπ/b · x²) · x ]`,  where `C₀ = 1/√|2π b|`.
3. **Inverse pass**  
   Use symplectic inverse parameters `(d, −b, −c, a)` and reuse the same kernel.
4. **Batch & Autograd**  
   • Sequence batching via broadcasting / `torch.vmap`.  
   • Cache chirp tensors with `register_buffer`; rebuild when parameters update.
5. **Mixed precision**  
   All constants cast to `x.dtype`; supports bf16 & (capability-gated) fp8.
6. **(Experimental) Lie-algebra parameterisation – SL(2,ℂ)**  
   • Model the generator `M' = p₁ H + p₂ X + p₃ Y ∈ 𝔰𝔩(2,ℂ)` with traceless basis `H = [[1,0],[0,-1]]`, `X = [[0,1],[0,0]]`, `Y = [[0,0],[1,0]]`.  
   • Learn complex coefficients `pᵢ ∈ ℂ` (6-real DOF) and obtain the canonical matrix via `M = torch.matrix_exp(M') ∈ SL(2,ℂ)` which always satisfies `det M = 1`.  
   • Parse `(a,b,c,d)` from `M` and route through the same chirp–FFT–chirp kernel.  
   • Unlocks non-unitary special cases (e.g.
     Laplace) and removes division–by–zero pitfalls when solving for `d`.  
   • Gate behind `lie_param=True`; **deferred** until MVP is merged and stabilised.
7. **Degeneracy safeguard**  
   • If `|b| < ε` (default `ε = 1e-4`) automatically switch to the `b ≈ 0` path with fast approximate resampling (identity shortcut when `d ≈ 1`).  
   • Emit a `logger.debug` or `wandb` counter (`lct/degen_hits`) each time the branch fires to monitor training stability.

### 3.3 Validation Suite

• FFT reduction: `(a,b,c) = (0,1,0)` → L2 < 1e-6 vs `torch.fft.fft`  
• Inverse consistency: `x ≈ layer.inverse(layer(x))` (max |err| < 1e-6)  
• Laplace, Fresnel, fractional Fourier (α ∈ {π/4, π/2, 3π/4})  
• Unitarity: `LCT · LCTᴴ ≈ I` for random N ≤ 256.

### 3.4 API & Docs

```python
layer = LCTLayer(size=1024, init=(0., 1., 0.), learnable=True)
y = layer(x)           # x: (batch, size)
z = layer.inverse(y)   # z ≈ x
```

Mathematical exposition lives in `docs/lct_math.md`; docstrings follow NumPy style and are rendered by Sphinx.

### 3.5 Performance Engineering

• Prefer `torch.fft.rfft` for real inputs.  
• Cache cuFFT plans across calls.  
• Provide `layer.cuda_graph()` for capture.  
• FP8 path gated by `torch.cuda.get_device_capability() ≥ (9,0)`.

### 3.6 Rule Compliance (`.cursor/rules/neurips_2025_plan.mdc`)

* `uv` for deps, `ruff/black/mypy` enforced in CI.  
* One git commit per atomic change; update `CHANGELOG.md` after public API edits.

### 3.7 NanoGPT Integration

• Add CLI flag `--use-lct` to `train_gpt*.py`.  
• Insert `LCTLayer` **along the sequence length dimension L**, immediately _before_ self-attention (`X → LCT → QKV`).  
• Represent complex output as `[Re ; Im]` concatenation ⇒ doubles the channel dimension fed to attention; an initial linear bottleneck can project back when required.  
• **Immediately** apply `nn.Linear(2d → d)` to restore the original width and contain FLOPs; weights initialised to block‐wise identity.  
• Alternate strategies (`magnitude`, `real-only`) kept for ablation (§3.11).  
• Account for RoPE interactions – monitor if LCT learns to normalise or warp positional phases.  
• Keep param-count parity (`in_features == out_features`) when concatenation is folded into the subsequent linear.  
• Forward-only sanity test `tests/test_nano_integration.py`.

### 3.8 Benchmark Harness

• `just bench:lct` logs tokens/s & VRAM to `records/YYYYMMDD_LCTBench/`.  
• Optional wandb upload when key present.

### 3.9 Continuous Integration

GitHub Action `{ubuntu-latest, macos-13}` × `{3.12, nightly}` running:
`uv pip install -e .[dev] && ruff . && black --check . && mypy --strict . && pytest -q`.

### 3.10 Packaging & Release

• Export `LCTLayer` in `torchlayers/__init__.py`.  
• Version `0.0.1` → TestPyPI; bump to `0.1.0` for camera-ready.  
• Create Zenodo DOI tag `v0.1.0`.

### 3.11 Ablation & Analysis

* **Layer impact** – baseline vs `--use-lct`.
* **Placement** – pre-attention vs post-attention vs dedicated block. _(P0)_
* **Complex-to-real mapping** – `[Re ; Im]` concat vs magnitude vs real-only. _(P0)_
* **Fixed vs learnable** – freeze parameters to FFT / FrFT / Fresnel vs fully learnable. _(P1)_
* **RoPE interaction** – compare runs with/without rotary embeddings. _(P1)_
* **Degeneracy threshold** – sweep `ε` for the `b≈0` switch. _(P2)_
Benchmarks report: tokens/s, wall-clock to target loss, FLOPs step overhead, memory, and parameter histograms `(a,b,c,d)`.

---

## 4. Backlog / Ideas

* Investigate constraining `(a,b,c)` on the tangent space of `Sp(2,ℝ)` to improve conditioning.
* Explore automatic parameter initialisation from data-driven moment matching.
* FP8 path: benchmark NF4 vs FP8-E4M3.
* Use `torch.compile` (TorchDynamo) to fuse chirp multiplications.
* Ensure conjugate 2π convention (`normalized=True`) matches NumPy ortho mode.
* **Non-norm preserving group law extension** – Implement a variant that prioritizes exact group law composition over unitarity. This would allow:
  - Exact composition of transforms without amplitude distortion
  - Simpler kernel implementation without half-sample corrections
  - Direct matrix multiplication for parameter composition
  - Trade-off: requires explicit renormalization after each transform

## 8. Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) Implementation Guide

### Overview

This section distills and refines the LCT implementation plan into a clear, executable guide for any O3 instance (or developer) to follow.  It focuses on:

* Practical module structure & responsibilities
* Parameter handling across general & special‐case regimes
* Caching/pre-computation strategy for efficiency
* Exhaustive test checkpoints and expected tolerances

The content is fully aligned with the `modded-nanogpt` environment, project conventions, and deliverables enumerated in §3.

---

### 8.1  Parameterisation & Key Equations

The continuous‐time Linear Canonical Transform is defined by
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix} \in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb R),\qquad ad-bc=1.
\]

1. **Generic case** \(b \neq 0\)
\[
X(u)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{i\,b}}\,e^{ i\pi\frac{d}{b}u^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i2\pi\frac{1}{b}ut}\; e^{ i\pi\frac{a}{b}t^2}\,x(t)\,dt.
\]

2. **Degenerate case** \(b = 0\)
\[
X(u)=\sqrt{d}\;e^{ i\pi c d u^2}\,x(d u).
\]

Special instances: identity, Fourier \((0,1,-1,0)\), fractional Fourier \((\cos\theta, \sin\theta, -\sin\theta, \cos\theta)\), and pure scaling.

---

### 8.2  Discrete-Time Strategy (Chirp–FFT–Chirp)

* **Input chirp**: \(C_{\text{in}}[n]=e^{ i\pi\frac{a}{b}n^2 }\)
* **FFT step**: one call to `torch.fft.fft` along the transform axis (optionally `fftshift`).
* **Output chirp**: \(C_{\text{out}}[m]=e^{ i\pi\frac{d}{b}m^2 }\).
* **Normalisation**: multiply by \(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{i b N}}\) so the operator is unitary in discrete \(\ell^2\).

When \(b=0\), bypass the FFT and instead resample + chirp multiply, using `torch.nn.functional.grid_sample` for non-integer scaling factors.

---

### 8.3  Functional Decomposition

```python
# torchlayers/functional/lct.py
from __future__ import annotations

import math
from typing import Final

import torch

Complex = torch.complex64  # local alias for brevity

π: Final[float] = math.pi


def _chirp_phase(length: int, coeff: float, /, centered: bool = True, *, device, dtype) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Return exp( i π * coeff * n^2 ) as 1-D complex tensor."""
    n = torch.arange(length, device=device, dtype=dtype)
    if centered:
        n = n - length // 2
    phase = 1j * π * coeff * n**2
    return torch.exp(phase)


def linear_canonical_transform(
    x: torch.Tensor,
    *,
    a: float,
    b: float,
    c: float,
    d: float,
    dim: int = -1,
    centered: bool = True,
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Apply the discrete LCT along *dim*.

    Pre-conditions: ``abs(a*d - b*c - 1) < 1e-6``.
    Returns a *complex* tensor regardless of the real/complex nature of *x*.
    """

    if abs(a * d - b * c - 1) > 1e-6:
        raise ValueError("LCT parameters must satisfy ad - bc = 1.")

    x = x.to(torch.complex64)
    N = x.size(dim)

    if b != 0:
        # --- generic path ---
        coeff_in = a / b
        coeff_out = d / b

        chirp_in = _chirp_phase(N, coeff_in, centered=centered, device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
        chirp_out = _chirp_phase(N, coeff_out, centered=centered, device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)

        # broadcast multiply
        x = x * torch.moveaxis(chirp_in, 0, dim)
        X = torch.fft.fft(x, dim=dim) / math.sqrt(N)
        X = X * torch.moveaxis(chirp_out, 0, dim)

        const = 1 / torch.sqrt(1j * torch.tensor(b, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device))
        return const * X

    # --- b == 0 path ---
    scale = d
    sqrt_d = torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device))

    length = torch.arange(N, device=x.device, dtype=torch.float32)
    if centered:
        length = length - N // 2
    t = scale * length  # sampled positions

    # normalise grid to [-1,1] for grid_sample
    grid = (2 * t / max(N - 1, 1)).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1)  # shape (1,N,1)
    x_unsq = x.unsqueeze(1)  # add channel dim for grid_sample: (B,1,N)
    resampled = torch.nn.functional.grid_sample(
        x_unsq.real, grid, mode="bilinear", padding_mode="zeros", align_corners=True
    ).squeeze(1) + 1j * torch.nn.functional.grid_sample(
        x_unsq.imag, grid, mode="bilinear", padding_mode="zeros", align_corners=True
    ).squeeze(1)

    chirp = _chirp_phase(N, c * d, centered=centered, device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
    resampled = sqrt_d * resampled * torch.moveaxis(chirp, 0, dim)
    return resampled
```

The high-level `LinearCanonicalTransform` module simply wraps the above, pre-computing chirps as `register_buffer`s when `seq_len` is known.

---

### 8.4  Caching & Mixed Precision

* **Buffers**: `chirp_in`, `chirp_out`, and the normalisation scalar are registered buffers ⇒ auto-moved with `.to(device)`.
* **Precision**: construct chirps in `float64` then cast to `x.dtype` for minimal phase error.
* **cuFFT plans**: PyTorch internally caches; no explicit management needed.

---

### 8.5  Verification Checklist (pytest)

1. _Fourier oracle_ – `(0,1,-1,0)` matches `torch.fft.fft` (tol ≤ 1e-6).
2. _Identity_ – `(1,0,0,1)` returns input exactly.
3. _Inverse_ consistency – `LCT(M⁻¹)(LCT(M)(x)) ≈ x`.
4. _Unitarity_ – `‖LCT(x)‖₂ == ‖x‖₂` within 1e-6.
5. _Group property_ – FrFT(θ₁) ∘ FrFT(θ₂) ≈ FrFT(θ₁+θ₂).
6. _Batch broadcasting_ – compare loop vs batched run.

All tests live in `tests/test_lct.py` & `tests/test_lct_special.py`.

---

### 8.6  Integration Notes

* CLI flag `--use-lct` toggles replacement of `nn.Linear` with `LCTLayer`.
* Preserve parameter count parity to ensure checkpoint compatibility.
* Expect complex tensors downstream ⇒ if real activations required, split channels or take magnitude/phase.

---

### 8.7  Future Extensions

* **Learnable parameters** constrained via angle/rapidity re-parameterisation.
* **2-D LCT** for vision tasks.
* **Chirp-Z** implementation for exact non-integer 1/\(b\) sampling.

---

_This guide supersedes earlier terse notes in §3 where overlap exists._

### 1.1  Execution Sprint Checklist (one-day)
1. `pytest -q` → all FFT/Laplace tests green.
2. Wire `--use-lct` flag & `[Re;Im]` concat+bottleneck in `train_gpt*.py`.
3. Run `just bench:lct` → record tokens/s vs baseline.
4. Draft `paper/outline.md` with 5-part structure (motivation, method, expt, results, impact).
5. Tick items in §1 table, commit & tag `v0.0.1-preview`.

## 9. Debugging Log – 2025-05-12

### Context
The dense-matrix discretisation was re-introduced to regain **exact group-law compliance** after the chirp–FFT–chirp path exposed missing 1/√|b| scaling.  A sequence of patches explored different amplitude constants and phase factors.

### What Was Tried
1. **Chirp–FFT–chirp with   C(b)=exp(−iπ sgn b/4)/√|b|**  
   • ✅ Unitarity (row/col norms ≈ 1)  
   • ❌ Composition: `T(S₂)·T(S₁)` vs `T(S₂·S₁)` differed by a *diagonal phase*.
2. **Dense kernel with phase   ((a/b)n² −2 n k +(d/b)k²)/N**  
   • ✅ Unitarity for ≥ 1 000 random draws (‖KᴴK−I‖∞ < 8e-7).  
   • ❌ Composition still fails ⇒ global phase or |b| magnitude issue.
3. **Amplitude variants**  
   a. `amp = exp(−iπ sgn b/4)/√N`  → unitarity good, composition fails.  
   b. `amp = 1/√N`                 → unitarity good, composition fails (same pattern).  
   c. `amp = 1/(√N √|b|)`         → composition marginally *worse* & unitarity broken.

The failure therefore lies **not** in row/column energy but in a *matrix-level phase* that depends on (a,b,c,d) non-trivially.

### Quantitative Failure Snapshot
```python
# Re-run of pytest -q on 2025-05-12 01:15 EDT
# Max-abs deviation for first failing composition test
out_seq    = tensor([...])
out_single = tensor([...])
err = (out_seq - out_single).abs().max()  # ⇒ 2.33e+0
```
Across the five parameter draws in `test_lct_composition` the max-abs error ranged from **0.27 → 2.33**.  Norm ratios in `test_lct_unitarity` swing between **0.69 → 7.8** when the |b| factor is present.

### Next Hypotheses
1. The discrete normalisation constant should be  
   `C(b) = exp(−iπ sgn(b)/4) / √(|b| N)` *and* the cross-term should be `-2 nk / (b N)` — but prior experiments suggest this over-scales by √|b| twice.  A symbolic derivation vs DFT matrix might clarify.
2. A missing **(1/|b|½)** **AND** per-sample phase tilt: multiplying `diag(exp(iπ (a n²)/bN))` on *both* sides could compensate.

> **TODO for next agent**:  Derive the exact discrete kernel constant by insisting on the group law algebraically (symbolic `sympy` solve) and adjust tests to compare up to a global phase rotation if that is mathematically legitimate.

### Focused reproduction – 45° FrFT × 2  (added 2025-05-12 14:05 EDT)

A minimal failing case is now cemented in `tests/test_lct_frft_debug.py`:

* compose two **45 ° fractional Fourier transforms**  \(\mathrm{FrFT}_{\pi/4}\) which **must** equal one 90 ° FrFT (the unitary FFT).
* The test strips one reference entry to cancel a potential *global* complex constant, yet fails with relative errors ≈ 1.

Observed pattern
* Unitarity still green → magnitude profile correct.
* Ratio `y_seq / y_fft` varies across indices → **index-dependent phase error**.

| H1  | Half-sample centring applied twice ⇒ net ±½ index shift                                 | rerun test with `centered=False` everywhere                      |
| H2  | FFT 'ortho' factor handled twice (missing/extra √N)                                     | divide second stage by √N & re-run                               |
| H3  | Global phase formula `exp(−iπ·sgn(b)/4)` missing additive term when composing           | compare product of two phases vs closed-form for combined matrix |
| H4  | Sign convention for quadratic coefficients `a/b`, `d/b` w.r.t negative `b` inconsistent | log coefficients per call & combined                             |

Next actionable steps
1. Parameter-sweep over `<centre flag × amplitude tweak>` grid; table the residuals.
2. Instrument debug helper to dump `(chirp_in, FFT, chirp_out, amp)` for both stages and the combined path.
3. Symbolically derive discrete kernel constant via *group-law first principles* (likely easiest in `sympy`).
4. Patch the offending term, rerun full suite; retire the debug test (keep as regression).

**Exit-criteria:** `pytest -q` fully green and `max_rel_err(FrFT×2 vs FFT) < 1e-6` up to a single global complex constant.

### 2025-05-12T18:10-0400 – Dense‐Kernel Amplitude vs Linear-Phase Sign

**What We Saw**
* Switching to the *exact* amplitude constant \(C(b)=1/\sqrt{i b N}\) alone fixed the norm ratio for *one* \((a,b,c)\) draw (<1 % error) but unitarity still failed across a sweep and FrFT×2 ≠ FFT.
* Residual error pattern ⇒ correct magnitudes, **index-dependent phase**.

**Diagnosis**
1. Quadratic terms already match the analytic kernel.
2. The half-sample linear-phase term implemented as
   ```python
   ((1/N - a) * n + (1/N - d) * k)
   ```
   has the **wrong sign** on the \(a\) and \(d\) contributions.
3. Constant phase looks algebraically consistent; will keep unchanged until re-tested.

**Patch**
```diff
- ((1.0 / N - a_c) * n_idx + (1.0 / N - d_c) * k_idx)
+ ((a_c - 1.0 / N) * n_idx + (d_c - 1.0 / N) * k_idx)
```

Keep amplitude:
```python
sqrt_ib = torch.sqrt(1j * b_c)
amp = 1.0 / (sqrt_ib * math.sqrt(N))
```

**Next Step** — implement sign fix, rerun full `pytest -q`.  Exit-criteria remain unchanged.

### 2025-05-12T??:?? – Fixed LCT Unitarity Issue

**Problem**  
The dense-kernel implementation of the Linear Canonical Transform was consistently producing matrices with:
* Row norms = 1/√|b| (instead of 1.0)
* Columns non-orthogonal

**Analysis**  
After testing multiple hypotheses:
1. The amplitude constant was using the continuum form `1/√(i*b*N)` 
2. This introduces an extra factor of √|b| in the denominator
3. For discrete unitarity, we need specifically `e^(-iπsgn(b)/4)/√N`

**Fix Applied**
```diff
- sqrt_ib = torch.sqrt(1j * b_c)
- amp128 = 1.0 / (sqrt_ib * math.sqrt(N))  # complex128
+ # Correct normalization for unitarity
+ phase_factor = torch.exp(-1j * torch.as_tensor(π/4, dtype=torch.complex128) * torch.sign(torch.real(b_c)))
+ amp128 = phase_factor / math.sqrt(N)  # complex128
```

**Results**
* Unitarity test now passes with error < 1e-7
* The fixing of amplitude normalization is sufficient; no changes to the phase terms were needed
* **BUT** composition tests still fail - sequential LCT applications don't match direct composed transform

**Next Steps**
Investigate the group law failure. Possible issues:
1. The global phase factor may need special adjustment when composing transformations
2. Need to carefully track the normalization constant across sequential transforms
3. The normalized=True flag may need to be handled specially for composition

## 2-Hour Sprint Plan (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC) – Paper First Focus
=====================================

Guiding principle (after Simon Peyton Jones): Write the paper **now** and let the code & experiments grow to make each section true.
The document becomes the schedule; every day ends with a commit to `paper/`.

Time-boxed in 10-minute "pomodoros".
Use `watch -n 60 just status` (or similar) to keep focus.

Legend:
⏱ = minutes budget •  ✅ = done •  🔄 = in-progress •  ⌛ = waiting

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
### 00:00-00:10  |  Branch & Commit Hygiene
⏱ 10
1. `git switch -c fix/lct-scaling-b0`  ✅
2. `pytest -q` (already green)  ✅
3. `git add torchlayers/functional/lct.py`  ✅
4. `git commit -S -m "fix(lct): correct b=0 resampling (unit tests green)"` ✅
5. `git switch main && git merge --no-ff fix/lct-scaling-b0` ✅
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased". ✅
7. Push. ✅

### 00:10-00:25  |  Paper Skeleton
⏱ 15
1. `git switch -c paper/bootstrap`
2. Copy NeurIPS 2025 template → `paper/main.tex`.
3. Create `paper/sections/intro.tex`, `method.tex`, `experiments.tex`, `results.tex`, `related.tex`, `conclusion.tex`.
4. Insert `\input{sections/…}` lines.
5. Compile once: `latexmk -pdf -silent paper/main.tex`.

### 00:25-00:35  |  Outline & Placeholders
⏱ 10
1. `paper/outline.md` – bullet headings mirroring sections.
2. Stub abstract (≤150 w placeholder).
3. Figure & table environments with TODO captions.

### 00:35-00:45  |  Automation Hooks
⏱ 10
1. Add Justfile entries:

2. CI: append step to GitHub Actions (skip if not essential now).

### 00:45-01:00  |  Method Section → LCT Overview
⏱ 15
Draft 2-paragraph description:
• Definition of discrete LCT; parameters (a,b,c,d).
• Our `LCTLayer`: learnable a,b,c; inverse analytically; GPU-friendly.

### 01:00-01:15  |  Experiments Scaffold
⏱ 15
1. Table skeleton (baseline vs LCT).
2. Text stub describing dataset (TinyShakespeare) and metrics.

### 01:15-01:30  |  Results & Discussion Placeholders
⏱ 15
1. Add Figure placeholder for speed-accuracy curve.
2. One bullet on expected gains (to be filled when numbers ready).

### 01:30-01:40  |  Related Work Quick List
⏱ 10
Bullets: FrFT in signal processing; FFT acceleration; efficient transformers.

### 01:40-01:50  |  Conclusion & Broader Impact Stubs
⏱ 10
Single paragraph each with TODO markers. Create `paper/sections/broader_impact.tex` and `paper/sections/checklist.tex`.

### 01:50-02:00  |  Finalise & Push
⏱ 10
1. `latexmk` – ensure PDF builds.
2. `git add paper/ Justfile CHANGELOG.md AGENT.md`
3. `git commit -S -m "docs(paper): bootstrap NeurIPS skeleton with outline"`
4. `git push --set-upstream origin paper/bootstrap`
5. Update `AGENT.md` log (timestamp + checklist ticks).
