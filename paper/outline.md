# Abstract Outline

## 1. Problem Statement
- Briefly describe the limitations of current transformer models or linear layers (e.g., Fourier-based) that our work addresses.
- Mention the specific challenge (e.g., efficiency, expressiveness, adaptability).

## 2. Proposed Solution & Contribution
- Clearly state our main contribution.
- Introduce the Adaptive Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) layer.
- Highlight its key characteristic: learnable parameters \(a,b,c\) generalizing existing transforms.
- *Example*: "We propose replacing Fourier-based linear layers with an adaptive LCT layer parameterized by \(a,b,c\) that strictly generalizes the DFT and other transforms."

## 3. Key Methods/Approach
- Briefly explain how the LCT layer is implemented and integrated.
- Mention its analytical inverse property.
- Indicate it's JIT-friendly and GPU-compatible (supports bf16 & fp8).

## 4. Main Results/Findings
- Summarize the key empirical results.
- *Example*: "Our LCT-augmented NanoGPT model achieves [X]% improvement in [metric] / [Y] tokens/sec on [benchmark dataset] compared to the baseline, with comparable or reduced parameter count."
- Mention results from unit tests (e.g., reduction to FFT, inverse reconstruction).

## 5. Broader Impact/Implications
- Briefly discuss the potential significance of this work.
- How could adaptive LCT layers benefit the broader field of deep learning or specific applications?
- Future directions (optional, if space permits).
