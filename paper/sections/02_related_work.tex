Fourier and fractional Fourier layers have been explored as global mixing operations in Transformers\citep{lee2021fnet,chi2022flashfft}.  The optical community has long studied the Linear Canonical Transform\citep{pei1997,chen2009} but its learnable discretisation in deep nets remains under‚Äêexplored.
