# Viewing Generated Images with `mcp-image-extractor`



## How to View an Image
1. Ensure the image is saved to disk.
2. Call either of the two extract functions:
   * `[mcp_image-extractor_extract_image_from_file]` – for local files
   * `[mcp_image-extractor_extract_image_from_url]` – for web-hosted images
3. Or call from base64
4. **Always supply an absolute file path** when using `*_extract_image_from_file`.

## Absolute Path Template
The workspace root is at `/Users/alokbeniwal/modded-nanogpt`

```text
/Users/alokbeniwal/modded-nanogpt/<relative_path_to_image>
```

A quick way to build this path in docs or tool calls is:

```bash
$(pwd)/<relative_path_to_image>
```

## Example
```jsonc
{
  "name": "mcp_image-extractor_extract_image_from_file",
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "/Users/alokbeniwal/modded-nanogpt/img/example_plot.png"
  }
}
```

## Expectations for Agents
* Prefer inspecting images yourselves rather than asking the user to open them.
* Use these tools in debugging LaTeX, verifying plotted outputs, or reviewing generated figures before submission.
* Reference this rule whenever you need to decide whether an image should be opened programmatically.
