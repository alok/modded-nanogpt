# Parallel Workstreams Rule

> All agents editing source code, documentation, or LaTeX must respect the parallel-workstream policy defined in [docs/agent_workstreams_2025-05-15.md](mdc:docs/agent_workstreams_2025-05-15.md).

## Scope
Applies to edits on:
* `**/*.py`
* `**/*.md`
* `**/*.tex`

## Policy Summary
1. Choose the correct branch / worktree – `code`, `paper`, or `checklist` – before making changes.
2. Do not modify files owned by another workstream; instead leave TODO comments or open an issue.
3. Use semantic commit messages and commit frequently.
4. After finishing, push to the corresponding branch and open a PR following the merge order:
   1. `code` → 2. `paper` → 3. `checklist`.

Following this rule prevents merge conflicts and enables parallel breadthwise progress toward the NeurIPS deadline.
