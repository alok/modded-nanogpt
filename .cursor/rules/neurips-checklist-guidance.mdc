# NeurIPS Checklist Guidance Rule

> All work contributing to the NeurIPS paper and agent coordination must consider the [NEURIPS_PAPER_CHECKLIST.md](mdc:NEURIPS_PAPER_CHECKLIST.md).

## Scope
Applies to edits on:
* `**/*.tex` (all LaTeX files in the `sections/` directory and `main.tex`)
* `AGENTS.md`

## Policy Summary
1. **Consult the Checklist**: Before and during writing or editing paper sections, review the [NEURIPS_PAPER_CHECKLIST.md](mdc:NEURIPS_PAPER_CHECKLIST.md) to ensure all relevant points are addressed.
2. **Agent 3 Responsibility**: Agent 3 is primarily responsible for ensuring the checklist is comprehensively filled out. However, all agents contributing to the paper should be mindful of the checklist items relevant to their assigned sections.
3. **Integration**: Ensure that justifications and references for checklist items are appropriately integrated into the paper content or supplemental materials.
4. **Reproducibility**: Pay special attention to checklist items concerning reproducibility, limitations, ethics, and broader impacts.

Following this rule will help ensure a compliant and high-quality NeurIPS submission.
