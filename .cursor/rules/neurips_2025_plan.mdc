## Deliverables & Checklists

### 1️⃣ Full Paper (≤9 pages main text, double‐column)  
*Finish the complete NeurIPS 2025 submission, not just an extended abstract.*
- [ ] Conform to NeurIPS 2025 **style & formatting** (double‐column, 10-pt font, ≤9 pages **main text** + references).  
  Reference: <https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/Submission>
- [ ] Provide a **self-contained introduction, method, experiments, results, and discussion** narrative.  
  Emphasise the novelty of adaptive LCT layers and their efficiency gains in NanoGPT.
- [ ] Include all mandated NeurIPS artefacts: checklist, broader-impact statement, and dataset/model documentation.
- [ ] Empirical table comparing NanoGPT + LCT vs baseline (tokens/s, perplexity).
- [ ] Figures illustrating architecture, speed-accuracy trade-off, and ablation results.
- [ ] Release **LaTeX source** and compiled **PDF** in `paper/`.
- [ ] If possible, include a short (≤2-minute) demo video link in supplementary materials.

### 2️⃣ LCT Layer
- [ ] Implement `class LCTLayer(nn.Module)` with learnable `a, b, c` (real scalars) and analytical inverse.
- [ ] JIT-friendly & GPU-compatible (support bf16 & fp8 where available).
- [ ] Unit tests validating:  
  * (i) reduces to FFT when \(a=0,b=1,c=0\)  
  * (ii) inverse reconstruction loss < 1e-6.
  * (iii) special-case coverage (Laplace, Fourier, fractional variants, Fresnel; check unitarity & reference matrices).
- [ ] TorchScript export passes.

### 3️⃣ Benchmark
- [ ] Provision target machine via `run.sh` or Justfile recipe.
- [ ] Compare tokens/sec of baseline vs LCT-augmented model.
- [ ] Log wandb run URLs in `records/`.

### 4️⃣ Agent Plan (`AGENT.md`)
- [ ] Keep chronological log of thoughts, decisions, and next actions.  Prefer checklist style.
- [ ] Each atomic change ⇒ *one git commit* (`git add -p` + signed commit).
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with semver bumps.

## Development Conventions

* Use **`uv`** for Python dependencies; no `pip`/`conda`.
* Linters: `ruff`, `mypy`, `black` – configured in `pyproject.toml`.
* Prefer **functional style** & small composable units.
* Plot intermediates with **Plotly**.
* All code ≥ Python 3.12.

## Automation Hooks

Whenever the same shell command is executed ≥3 times, propose a **Justfile** target.  Store common one-liners in `.just-cache/`.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Forgetting to bump version in `pyproject.toml` after API change | `just version:bump` |
| Committing large notebooks | Avoid – use VSCode `# %%` files |
| Missing CHANGELOG entry | Add under `## [Unreleased]` |

## Immediate Next Actions (sync `@AGENT.md`)

| Priority | Task | When |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| 🔥 | Build repo skeleton & smoke-test MVP `LCTLayer` | Today |
| 🔥 | Draft abstract outline (`paper/outline.md`) | Today |
| 🔥 | Wire into NanoGPT `--use-lct` flag | Today |
| 🆕 | Oracle tests (Fourier, Laplace) | Today |
| 🆕 | Quick benchmark script `just bench:lct` | Today |
| ⚠️ | Update results table & abstract numbers | Today |
| ℹ️ | Tag preview `v0.0.1` | Today |

## Milestones (high-level check-points)

1. **LCT Minimum Viable Layer** – code complete & passes unit tests.
2. **Integration** – NanoGPT runs with `--use-lct` replacing `nn.Linear`.
3. **Benchmark** – tokens/s baseline vs LCT plotted; results saved in `img/`.
4. **Special-Case Compliance** – Laplace, Fresnel, FrFT, unitarity tests green.
5. **Paper** – Full NeurIPS 2025 paper (≤9 pages) passes style checker and compiles.
6. **Submission Package** – Tagged release `v0.1.0` with Zenodo DOI.
