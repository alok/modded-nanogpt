# Shell Command Guidelines – Avoid Here-Documents (`<<`)

## Introduction
The CI and local development environments frequently run under *fish* or *zsh*. Fish, in particular, does **not** support Bash-style here-documents (`<<`) that the assistant sometimes emits when composing multi-line commands (e.g. to execute embedded Python).

Using those constructs causes cryptic errors such as:

```text
fish: Expected a string, but found a redirection
python - <<'PY'
          ^
```

## Rule
1. **Never** output a shell command that relies on `<<` here-document redirection.
2. To run multi-line Python, prefer one of:
   * Inline one-liner via `python -c "import ...; ..."`.
   * Write the script to a temporary file and execute it.
   * Use `printf`/`cat <<'EOF'` *inside* a Bash subshell invoked via `bash -c` (only when unavoidable and clearly supported).
3. Keep commands single-line in `run_terminal_cmd` calls to comply with the tool schema.
4. When piping large blocks of code, write to a file first (e.g. `echo "..." > tmp.py && python tmp.py`).

## Example – Preferred Pattern

```bash
# Good: inline one-liner
python -c "import torch, math; print(math.sqrt(2))" | cat
```

## Anti-Pattern

```bash
# Bad: fish balks at the here-doc
python - <<'PY'
print('hello')
PY
```
